### How to play
- **Move** : Left controller / WASD
- **Look** : Right controller / Mouse Pointer
- **Fire** : Fire button /  A Button (XBox) / Left Click / Spacebar
- **Reload** : Reload button / X Button (XBox) / R key
- **Rotate weapon** : Switch button / Y Button (XBox) / Q key
- **Toggle auto-firing** : Autofire button / RB Button (XBox) / Middle Click

### Character Weapons

- **Rifle** : single shot, high damage, low crit rate
- **Shotgun** :  spread shot, low damage, high crit rate
- **Grenade launcher** : profoundly powerful but reload it take so much time

### Zombies:

- **Normal Zombie** : yeh normal zombie what are you looking for ?
- **Super Zombie** : just a normal zombie with XXXXL size and can one-punch you (if lucky).

### Environment items

- **Walls and ramps** : just stay there to blocking bullets, or zombies, or anything else moving out of my expectations.
- **Red barrel** : barrels with warm water to wash away any nearby zombies.

### Notes:

- To lower play effort, Player is immune to bullet and barrel damages.
- Player can move past zombies (but still get hit).
